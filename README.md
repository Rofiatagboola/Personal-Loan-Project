# Personal-Loan-Project
<p> The project aims to assess the existence and performance of a predictive model for income estimation.
		By exploring various modeling techniques, such as regression analysis or machine learning algorithms, 
		the goal is to develop a reliable model that can accurately predict income based on the identified factors.
		This model evaluation will involve using appropriate metrics and statistical measures to gauge its effectiveness.</p>
